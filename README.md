# Streaming Service Nix Flakes 

I wanted to make my custom SteamOS (based on NixOS) have the ability to stream stuff. The easiest way is to run something in kiosk mode and link that in Steam. 

# What to Do

- Install Nix and enable flakes. 
- On Desktop Steam, add a non-Steam game. 
- Point to one of the .sh files for the respective service. 
- Profit!

# Why? 

- I was having a lot of trouble getting stuff work consistently when trying to run streaming on my Steam box. The easiest way to get a clean environment is a Nix flake.
